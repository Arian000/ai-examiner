ANS: 3,"To find the number of new cases in men during one year after the study, we need to calculate the incidence rate in men and then multiply it by the number of men in the population.

First, let's calculate the incidence rate in men:
- Total population = 2000 men + 3000 women = 5000
- Participation rate in men = 60% = 0.6
- Disease frequency in participated men = 20% = 0.2
- Incidence rate in men = (Disease frequency in participated men / Participation rate in men) * 100 = (0.2 / 0.6) * 100 = 33.33%

Next, let's calculate the number of new cases in men:
- Incidence rate in total sample = 13% = 0.13
- Incidence rate in women = Incidence rate in men / 2 = 33.33% / 2 = 16.67%
- Number of women in the population = 3000
- Number of new cases in women = Incidence rate in women * Number of women = 16.67% * 3000 = 500
- Number of new cases in men = Incidence rate in men * Number of men = 33.33% * 2000 = 666.67

Therefore, the number of new cases in men during one year after the study is approximately 667.

ANS: 4","First, let's calculate the number of men and women who participated in the study:

Number of men participated = 2000 * 0.6 = 1200
Number of women participated = 3000 * 0.8 = 2400

Next, let's calculate the number of men and women who were lost to follow-up:

Number of men lost to follow-up = 60
Number of women lost to follow-up = 60

Now, let's calculate the number of men and women who completed the study:

Number of men completed the study = Number of men participated - Number of men lost to follow-up = 1200 - 60 = 1140
Number of women completed the study = Number of women participated - Number of women lost to follow-up = 2400 - 60 = 2340

Next, let's calculate the number of new cases in men and women during one year after the study:

Number of new cases in men = Number of men completed the study * Incidence rate in men = 1140 * 0.13 = 148.2
Number of new cases in women = Number of women completed the study * Incidence rate in women = 2340 * 0.13 = 304.2

Since the question states that the disease incidence in men was 2 times that in women, we can calculate the number of new cases in men as:

Number of new cases in men = 2 * Number of new cases in women = 2 * 304.2 = 608.4

Since we cannot have a fraction of a case, the number of new cases in men during one year after the study would be rounded to the nearest whole number, which is 608.

ANS: 2,"To calculate the smoking prevalence in the population at the start of the study, we need to consider the incidence rate and the number of new cases observed during the follow-up period.

The incidence rate is the proportion of the population that develops the condition (in this case, starts smoking) during a specific time period. In this case, the incidence rate is given as 20%.

The number of new cases observed during the follow-up period is 400.

To calculate the smoking prevalence at the start of the study, we can use the formula:

Prevalence = (Incidence rate * Number of new cases) / Sample size

Plugging in the values:

Prevalence = (0.20 * 400) / 5000

Prevalence = 0.16

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Prevalence = 0.16 * 100 = 16%

Therefore, the smoking prevalence in this population at the start of the study is 16%.

ANS: 1","To calculate the smoking prevalence in the population at the start of the study, we need to consider the incidence rate and the duration of the study.

The incidence rate is the number of new cases (400) divided by the sample size (5000), which gives us 0.08 or 8%.

The duration of the study is one year.

To calculate the smoking prevalence, we can use the formula:

Prevalence = Incidence rate x Duration

Prevalence = 8% x 1 year = 8%

Therefore, the smoking prevalence in this population at the start of the study is 8%.

ANS: 3,"To estimate the prevalence of obesity in the whole population, we need to consider the prevalence rates in each subgroup and their respective proportions in the population. 

Given the information provided, we can calculate the weighted average of the prevalence rates in each subgroup to estimate the overall prevalence of obesity in the population.

Let's calculate the weighted average:

Urban area: 39% prevalence, proportion in population unknown
Rural area: 32% prevalence, proportion in population unknown
Women: 45% prevalence, proportion in population unknown
Men: 30% prevalence, proportion in population unknown
Less than 40s: 37% prevalence, proportion in population unknown
40 years old and above: 47% prevalence, proportion in population unknown
Least prevalence province: 27% prevalence, proportion in population unknown
Most prevalent province: 47% prevalence, proportion in population unknown

Since we don't have information about the proportions of each subgroup in the population, we cannot accurately estimate the overall prevalence of obesity. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANS: None of the options provided (None of the above)","To estimate the prevalence of obesity in the whole population, we need to consider the prevalence rates in each subgroup and their respective proportions in the population. 

Let's calculate the weighted average of the prevalence rates in each subgroup:

Rural area: 32% (weight = proportion of population in rural area)
Women: 45% (weight = proportion of population that are women)
Men: 30% (weight = proportion of population that are men)
Less than 40s: 37% (weight = proportion of population that are less than 40s)
40 years old and above: 47% (weight = proportion of population that are 40 years old and above)
Least prevalence province: 27% (weight = proportion of population in the least prevalence province)
Most prevalent province: 47% (weight = proportion of population in the most prevalent province)

To calculate the weighted average, we multiply each prevalence rate by its respective weight, sum them up, and divide by the total weight:

(39% * weight1 + 32% * weight2 + 45% * weight3 + 30% * weight4 + 37% * weight5 + 47% * weight6 + 27% * weight7 + 47% * weight8) / (weight1 + weight2 + weight3 + weight4 + weight5 + weight6 + weight7 + weight8)

ANS: 4,"To estimate the population rate correctly, we need a sample that is representative of the population. In this case, since girls consist of 60% of the population, we need a sample that reflects this gender ratio.

The prevalence rate of water pipe smoking in girls is 55%, which means that in a sample of girls, we would expect approximately 55% of them to be water pipe smokers.

Similarly, the prevalence rate of water pipe smoking in boys is also 55%, so in a sample of boys, we would expect approximately 55% of them to be water pipe smokers.

Therefore, to estimate the population rate correctly, we need a sample that consists of 60% girls and 40% boys, with both groups having a prevalence rate of 55%.

ANS: 1,"To calculate the disease frequency in women, we need to first determine the disease frequency in men. We know that the overall disease frequency in the sample is 10%. Let's assume the disease frequency in men is x%.

Since the risk in men is two times that of women, the disease frequency in women would be half of that in men, which is (x/2)%.

Now, let's calculate the disease frequency in men:
Number of men = 1500
Disease frequency in men = (x/100) * 1500

The total number of people with the disease in the sample is:
Number of people with the disease = (10/100) * 2500

Since the disease frequency in men is two times that in women, we can write the equation:
(x/100) * 1500 = (x/2/100) * (2500 - 1500)

Simplifying the equation:
(x/100) * 1500 = (x/200) * 1000
(x/100) * 1500 = (x/2) * 10
(x/100) * 1500 = (x/2) * 10 * 100
(x/100) * 1500 = (x/2) * 1000
15x = 1000x
15 = 1000

This equation is not possible, as 15 does not equal 1000. Therefore, the disease frequency in women cannot be calculated.

Disease frequency in men = (x/100) * 1500

The total number of people with the disease in the sample is 10% of 2500, which is (10/100) * 2500.

Since the disease frequency in men is twice that of women, we can write the equation:
(x/100) * 1500 = 2 * [(x/2)/100] * (2500 - 1500)

Simplifying the equation:
(x/100) * 1500 = (x/100) * 1000

Solving for x:
1500x = 1000x
500x = 0
x = 0

Since x = 0, it means there is no disease in men. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate the disease frequency in women.

ANS: 1,"To calculate the two months incidence of the disease, we need to determine the number of new cases that occurred during the follow-up period and divide it by the number of people at risk.

Given that 2500 persons were assessed at the beginning of the study and the prevalence of the disease was 20%, we can calculate the number of people at risk as follows:

Number of people at risk = Total number of persons - Number of prevalent cases
Number of people at risk = 2500 - (2500 * 0.20)
Number of people at risk = 2500 - 500
Number of people at risk = 2000

Now, we can calculate the two months incidence of the disease:

Incidence = (Number of new cases / Number of people at risk) * 100
