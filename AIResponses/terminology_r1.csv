"Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) in epidemiology is a measure of the impact of premature mortality on a population. It is calculated by subtracting the age at death from a predetermined end point, often the average life expectancy. This provides an estimate of the years a person would have lived if they had not died prematurely. It is used to highlight areas of public health concern and to identify disparities in health outcomes.",Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) is a measure used in epidemiology to estimate the impact of premature mortality on a population. It quantifies the number of years that individuals would have lived if they had not died prematurely. It is calculated by subtracting the age at death from a predetermined standard life expectancy.,Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) is a measure used in epidemiology to estimate the impact of premature mortality on a population.
