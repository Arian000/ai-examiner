"Age-adjusted mortality rate in epidemiology is a measure that takes into account the age distribution of a population to compare mortality rates between different populations or over time. It is calculated by applying age-specific death rates to a standard population, which allows for a more accurate comparison of mortality rates by removing the effect of differences in age distribution.","Age-adjusted mortality rate in epidemiology is a measure that takes into account the age distribution of a population to compare mortality rates between different populations or over time.
