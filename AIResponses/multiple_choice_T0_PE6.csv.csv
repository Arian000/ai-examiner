"To calculate the disease frequency in women, we need to first determine the disease frequency in men. Given that the disease frequency in the sample is 10%, and the risk in men is two times that of women, we can calculate the disease frequency in men as follows:

Disease frequency in men = 10% * 2 = 20%

Since the total sample size is 2500, and 1500 of them are men, we can calculate the number of women in the sample as follows:

Number of women = Total sample size - Number of men
Number of women = 2500 - 1500 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the disease frequency in women:

Disease frequency in women = (Number of women with the disease / Total number of women) * 100
Disease frequency in women = (0 / 1000) * 100 = 0%

Therefore, the disease frequency in women is 0%.

Therefore, the disease frequency in women is 0%.

"The mean survival time in the study was 12 months, and the follow-up time for each individual was 2 months. Since only one person caught the disease during the follow-up, we can calculate the number of studied persons by dividing the mean survival time by the follow-up time. 

12 months / 2 months = 6

Therefore, the number of studied persons is 6.

"To calculate the maximum expected validity of the test, we need to determine the sensitivity and specificity. 

Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives (patients with the condition who test positive) out of all individuals with the condition. In this case, the sensitivity would be calculated as 180 (true positives) divided by the total number of patients with the condition, which is 200. So the sensitivity is 180/200 = 0.9 or 90%.

Specificity is the proportion of true negatives (healthy persons who test negative) out of all individuals without the condition. In this case, the specificity would be calculated as 250 (true negatives) divided by the total number of healthy persons, which is 300. So the specificity is 250/300 = 0.8333 or 83.33%.

To calculate the maximum expected validity, we take the average of sensitivity and specificity. So the maximum expected validity would be (90% + 83.33%)/2 = 86.67%.

Therefore, the correct answer is 3. 85%.","To calculate the maximum expected validity of the test, we need to determine the sensitivity and specificity. 

Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives among all the individuals who actually have the condition. In this case, the true positives are the 180 positive results among the 200 patients. So, the sensitivity is 180/200 = 0.9 or 90%.

Specificity is the proportion of true negatives among all the individuals who do not have the condition. In this case, the true negatives are the 250 negative results among the 300 healthy persons. So, the specificity is 250/300 = 0.8333 or 83.33%.

The maximum expected validity of the test is the higher value between sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the maximum expected validity of the test is 90%.

"To determine the prevalence at which the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test will be 90%, we need to consider the formula for PPV:

PPV = (Sensitivity * Prevalence) / [(Sensitivity * Prevalence) + (1 - Specificity) * (1 - Prevalence)]

Given that both sensitivity and specificity are 90%, we can substitute these values into the formula:

0.9 = (0.9 * Prevalence) / [(0.9 * Prevalence) + (1 - 0.9) * (1 - Prevalence)]

Simplifying the equation:

0.9 = (0.9 * Prevalence) / [0.9 * Prevalence + 0.1 - 0.1 * Prevalence]

0.9 = (0.9 * Prevalence) / [0.8 * Prevalence + 0.1]

Cross-multiplying:

0.9 * [0.8 * Prevalence + 0.1] = 0.9 * Prevalence

0.72 * Prevalence + 0.09 = 0.9 * Prevalence

0.09 = 0.18 * Prevalence

Prevalence = 0.09 / 0.18

Prevalence = 0.5

Therefore, the PPV of the test will be 90% when the disease prevalence is 50%.
