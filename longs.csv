incidence,"In epidemiology, incidence refers to the number of new cases of a specific disease or health condition that develop within a given population during a defined period of time. It is often expressed as the incidence rate, which is the number of new cases divided by the total population at risk, multiplied by a multiplier value (usually 1,000 or 100,000) to standardize the rate."
Point prevalence,"Point prevalence in epidemiology refers to the proportion of individuals in a population who have a specific disease or condition at a particular point in time. It provides an estimate of the burden of disease at a specific moment, as opposed to measuring incidence or prevalence over a period of time."
